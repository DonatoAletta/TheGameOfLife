✅ Rules for Each Generation

Underpopulation
A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors → dies (as if by loneliness).

Survival
A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors → lives on to the next generation.

Overpopulation
A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors → dies (as if by overcrowding).

Reproduction
A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors → becomes alive (as if by reproduction).
